# Machine Learning Study Repository ðŸ¤–

Welcome to my machine learning study repository! This repo is a collection of practice notebooks, experiments, and projects as I explore core ML concepts, algorithms, and workflows.

## ðŸ“š **Contents**  
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter/Colab notebooks covering topics like regression, classification, clustering, and model evaluation.  
- **Data**: All datasets used in the notebooks are stored in the [`Data`](./Data) folder.  
- **Projects**: Small implementations (e.g., predictive models, EDA pipelines).  

## ðŸš€ **Getting Started**  
1. Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HamadKhan345/ml-study-repo.git
